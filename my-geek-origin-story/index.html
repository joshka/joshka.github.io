            <p>Like many a software engineer does again and again, I'm restarting my blog. This time I'm going to
kick this iteration off with an idea inspired by <a href="http://delicategeniusblog.com">Michael Kordahi
(@delicateGenius)</a> many years ago for Tech.Ed 2011, the <a href="http://delicategeniusblog.com/my-geek-origin-story-whats-yours/">Geek Origin
Story</a>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>One of my earliest memories of computers was at the age of 6 or 7 finding a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CP-Handbook-Mp-Rodnay-Zaks/dp/0895880482">The CP/M
Handbook</a> in my dad's bookshelf.
Now at the time, we didn't have a computer at all, but that didn't matter for a kid that read
everything in sight. I read that thing cover to cover.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.joshka.net/my-geek-origin-story/The_CPM_Handbook_with_MPM.jpg" alt="The CPM Handbook" /></p>
<p>It wasn't till a few months later when we stopped by a garage sale and I spied an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Executive">Osborne
Executive</a> sitting on a table that I was able to
put into practice the things I'd learnt. $80 later and we now had a "portable" computer that I was
able to learn to write programs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBASIC">MBASIC 1.0</a>, and create
documents using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a>. Now portable is really one of
those relative terms, this thing was heavy. In fact I'd hazard a guess that the keyboard itself
would weigh more than most laptops these days.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.joshka.net/my-geek-origin-story/OsborneExecutive1983.jpg" alt="Osborne Executive" /></p>
<p>What followed was many happy days of typing in BASIC programs from books (borrowed from the public
library) into that 7 inch orange and black screen. I remember spending hours poring over a stack of
tractor feed paper containing the source code to an adventure game I'd found, wanting to know what
made it tick.</p>
<p>I was lucky to find myself at a primary school from grade 3 that encouraged me to continue my
programming education (this time on the Apple IIe, followed by various Macintoshes), while at the
same time coming home to various IBM clones. BASIC gave way to Turbo Pascal, then C++, C, and a
variety of other languages. More and more frequent visits to computer fairs allowed me to get an
understanding of the hardware configuration side of things.</p>
<p>My first exposure to the world of networked computers came at a friend's place, in the early 1990s
where we put together a 10Base2 network running Novell DOS (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS">DR
DOS</a>), and learnt all about the technologies necessary to play
computer games against each other (so many shenanigans to get the maximum amount of RAM with those
pesky drivers).</p>
<p>A brief foray into local BBSes preceded the discovery of this thing called The Internet, followed
shortly after by creating my first GeoCities pages (with some typical angsty teen name). Learning to
write CGI programs in Perl and C came next.</p>
<p>A few years later I picked up my first part time paid gig while still in high school, writing a
program in Microsoft Access VBA to categorize a fairly hefty suppliers catalog of motorcycle parts
for an eCommmerce site. It didn't pay much but it cemented the idea that I could work in the field
that I found so much enjoyment out of.</p>
<p>I decided to undertake university studies in Computer Engineering, but ended up dropping out as I
found the real world workplace more interesting than learning things I'd been doing most of my life.
I sometimes regret not finishing, but so far, it's not held me back from delivering software
projects big and small.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been really fortunate to be able to make something that I found a passion for at an
early age into a job. I never would have imagined that that one book would have lead to all the
interesting things I've worked on over the course of my career.</p>
