Hi, I'm Josh McKinney, a professional software engineer from Australia currently
residing in Nashville TN. I live and breathe software development, having spent
the last 15 or so years building systems in a variety of industries including
eCommmerce, healthcare, finance, transportation, and many government
agencies.

I'm looking for an opportunity to be part of something awesome in Seattle, WA.
Check out [my resume](/resume/) and let's get acquainted.
