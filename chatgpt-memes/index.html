            <p>I was curious about how ChatGPT would go with creating this era's main cultural output, memes after
reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34516204">a comment by @jeisc on Hacker news</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone here really think that AI will produce a new "Jungle Book" by Kipling or a new "Mona
Lisa" by Da Vinci or a new "Requiem" by Mozart" which could even have a remote possibility of
becoming cultural icon and reference? And is that a goal or event that the spectators are waiting
for? And if it occurs what would it infer about human cultural evolution?</p>

<p>Prompt: Come up with some ideas for a new meme format</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>1. &quot;X, but Y&quot; - A meme format where a popular phrase or concept is followed by
</span><span>   &quot;but&quot; and a humorous twist or unexpected outcome. For example, &quot;Going to the
</span><span>   gym, but it&#39;s just for the air conditioning.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;X in the time of Y&quot; - A meme format where a current event or trend is
</span><span>   juxtaposed with a historical or fictional setting. For example, &quot;Online
</span><span>   school in the time of the Black Death.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;X, Y, and Z&quot; - A meme format where three seemingly unrelated things are
</span><span>   combined in a humorous way. For example, &quot;Cats, capitalism, and communism.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;X, if you&#39;re Y&quot; - A meme format where a statement or image is presented with
</span><span>   a specific group of people in mind. For example, &quot;The perfect breakfast, if
</span><span>   you&#39;re a vampire.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;X, but with a twist&quot; - A meme format where a popular image or phrase is
</span><span>   altered in a unexpected way. For example, &quot;The Mona Lisa, but with a
</span><span>   surprised expression.&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Prompt: Come up with a new meme format that is based on an image that is the same every time, but
the words are different.</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>&quot;X, but Y&quot; - A meme format where a image of a person or thing is the same in
</span><span>every meme, but the captions on the image are different, providing a humorous
</span><span>twist or unexpected outcome. For example, the image could be a &quot;Confused Nick
</span><span>Young&quot; image with different captions like &quot;Me trying to understand how a vaccine
</span><span>works&quot;, &quot;Me trying to understand how taxes work&quot; or &quot;Me trying to understand how
</span><span>a lawnmower works&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Prompt: Instead of coming up with captions for an existing image, suggest a new image that could be
created by AI and used for adding text to. The image would be the same every time, but the text
would change.</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>One idea for an image that could be created by AI and used for adding text to is
</span><span>an image of a robot or AI with a blank, emotionless expression. The robot or AI
</span><span>could be presented in different settings or contexts, such as in an office or at
</span><span>home. This image could be used for a meme format where the captions highlight
</span><span>the robot or AI&#39;s lack of emotions or understanding of human behavior. For
</span><span>example, &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans need to sleep&quot;, &quot;Robot trying to
</span><span>understand sarcasm&quot;, &quot;Robot trying to understand the concept of love&quot;
</span><span>---
</span></code></pre>
<p>Prompt: Ok, come up with a prompt for midjourney that would create the robot in this example.</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>&quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression in a setting of
</span><span>a living room. The robot should have a humanoid shape and should be standing in
</span><span>a neutral position.&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Prompt: Write a list of meme captions for this</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans need to sleep&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand sarcasm&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand the concept of love&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans watch reality TV&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand the concept of &#39;too much information&#39;&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans take pictures of their food&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand the concept of &#39;I&#39;m not mad, just disappointed&#39;&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans are obsessed with memes&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand the concept of &#39;I can&#39;t even&#39;&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Robot trying to understand why humans need to have hobbies&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Prompt: Write a list of prompts. One for each of the captions above.</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot sitting on a couch with a blank, emotionless
</span><span>   expression and its head tilted to one side, as if it is trying to understand
</span><span>   why humans need to sleep.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its arms
</span><span>   crossed, as if it is trying to understand sarcasm.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot standing in front of a window with a blank,
</span><span>   emotionless expression, as if it is trying to understand the concept of
</span><span>   love.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot sitting on a couch with a blank, emotionless
</span><span>   expression and a remote control in its hand, as if it is trying to understand
</span><span>   why humans watch reality TV.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its hand
</span><span>   on its chin, as if it is trying to understand the concept of &#39;too much
</span><span>   information&#39;.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot holding a camera with a blank, emotionless
</span><span>   expression, as if it is trying to understand why humans take pictures of
</span><span>   their food.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and arms
</span><span>   crossed, as if it is trying to understand the concept of &#39;I&#39;m not mad, just
</span><span>   disappointed&#39;.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and
</span><span>   scrolling through a phone, as if it is trying to understand why humans are
</span><span>   obsessed with memes.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its head
</span><span>   in its hands, as if it is trying to understand the concept of &#39;I can&#39;t
</span><span>   even&#39;.&quot;
</span><span>1. &quot;Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and a
</span><span>   paintbrush in its hand, as if it is trying to understand why humans need to
</span><span>   have hobbies.&quot;

<p>Is this funny? Meaningful? Who knows?</p>
<p>Actually, ...</p>
<p>Prompt: Could the memes generated from this have a remote possibility of becoming cultural icon and
reference? And is that a goal or event that the humans are waiting for? And if it occurs what would
it infer about human cultural evolution?</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>It is possible that the memes generated from this image of a robot with a
</span><span>blank, emotionless expression could become a cultural icon and reference,
</span><span>although it is difficult to predict which memes will become popular and enduring
</span><span>cultural phenomena. The goal of creating memes is often to entertain and engage
</span><span>with a particular online community, rather than to become a cultural icon.
</span><span>
</span><span>If a meme generated from this image were to become a cultural icon, it could
</span><span>suggest that humans find the idea of a robot trying to understand human behavior
</span><span>and emotions to be relatable or amusing. It could also indicate that the concept
</span><span>of AI and robots trying to understand human behavior has become a prevalent
</span><span>theme in popular culture.
</span><span>
</span><span>However, it&#39;s important to note that memes are a form of digital culture that
</span><span>can be ephemeral and change rapidly, so it&#39;s not a certainty that this meme will
</span><span>become a cultural icon or reference, but it could be a possibility.
