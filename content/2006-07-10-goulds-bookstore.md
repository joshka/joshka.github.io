On the way back from the Hunter I discovered the best second hand bookstore I've ever seen (in

anything from Sci-Fi to communist propaganda. It even has a couple of cats that live there.

Picked Up:

* Corman, Leiserson, Rivest - Introduction to Algorithms
* Bruce Schneir - Secrets and Lies
* Scott Adams - The Dilbert Principle
* Some trashy cyberpunk novel that I can't remember the name of
