@jeisc [asks on Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34516204):

> Does anyone here really think that AI will produce a new "Jungle Book" by Kipling or a new "Mona Lisa" by Da Vinci or a new "Requiem" by Mozart" which could even have a remote possibility of becoming cultural icon and reference? And is that a goal or event that the spectators are waiting for? And if it occurs what would it infer about human cultural evolution?

I was curious about how ChatGPT would go with creating memes (this era's main cultural output). Here goes nothing:

> Come up with some ideas for a new meme format

    "X, but Y" - A meme format where a popular phrase or concept is followed by "but" and a humorous twist or unexpected outcome. For example, "Going to the gym, but it's just for the air conditioning."

    "X in the time of Y" - A meme format where a current event or trend is juxtaposed with a historical or fictional setting. For example, "Online school in the time of the Black Death."

    "X, Y, and Z" - A meme format where three seemingly unrelated things are combined in a humorous way. For example, "Cats, capitalism, and communism."

    "X, if you're Y" - A meme format where a statement or image is presented with a specific group of people in mind. For example, "The perfect breakfast, if you're a vampire."

    "X, but with a twist" - A meme format where a popular image or phrase is altered in a unexpected way. For example, "The Mona Lisa, but with a surprised expression."

> Come up with a new meme format that is based on an image that is the same every time, but the words are different.

    "X, but Y" - A meme format where a image of a person or thing is the same in every meme, but the captions on the image are different, providing a humorous twist or unexpected outcome. For example, the image could be a "Confused Nick Young" image with different captions like "Me trying to understand how a vaccine works", "Me trying to understand how taxes work" or "Me trying to understand how a lawnmower works"

> Instead of coming up with captions for an existing image, suggest a new image that could be created by AI and used for adding text to. The image would be the same every time, but the text would change.

    One idea for an image that could be created by AI and used for adding text to is an image of a robot or AI with a blank, emotionless expression. The robot or AI could be presented in different settings or contexts, such as in an office or at home. This image could be used for a meme format where the captions highlight the robot or AI's lack of emotions or understanding of human behavior. For example, "Robot trying to understand why humans need to sleep", "Robot trying to understand sarcasm", "Robot trying to understand the concept of love"

> Ok, come up with a prompt for midjourney that would create the robot in this example.

    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression in a setting of a living room. The robot should have a humanoid shape and should be standing in a neutral position."

> Write a list of meme captions for this

    "Robot trying to understand why humans need to sleep"
    "Robot trying to understand sarcasm"
    "Robot trying to understand the concept of love"
    "Robot trying to understand why humans watch reality TV"
    "Robot trying to understand the concept of 'too much information'"
    "Robot trying to understand why humans take pictures of their food"
    "Robot trying to understand the concept of 'I'm not mad, just disappointed'"
    "Robot trying to understand why humans are obsessed with memes"
    "Robot trying to understand the concept of 'I can't even'"
    "Robot trying to understand why humans need to have hobbies"

> Write a list of prompts. One for each of the captions above.

    "Create an image of a robot sitting on a couch with a blank, emotionless expression and its head tilted to one side, as if it is trying to understand why humans need to sleep."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its arms crossed, as if it is trying to understand sarcasm."
    "Create an image of a robot standing in front of a window with a blank, emotionless expression, as if it is trying to understand the concept of love."
    "Create an image of a robot sitting on a couch with a blank, emotionless expression and a remote control in its hand, as if it is trying to understand why humans watch reality TV."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its hand on its chin, as if it is trying to understand the concept of 'too much information'."
    "Create an image of a robot holding a camera with a blank, emotionless expression, as if it is trying to understand why humans take pictures of their food."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and arms crossed, as if it is trying to understand the concept of 'I'm not mad, just disappointed'."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and scrolling through a phone, as if it is trying to understand why humans are obsessed with memes."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and its head in its hands, as if it is trying to understand the concept of 'I can't even'."
    "Create an image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression and a paintbrush in its hand, as if it is trying to understand why humans need to have hobbies."

Is this funny? Meaningful? Who knows?

Actually, ...

> Could the memes generated from this have a remote possibility of becoming cultural icon and reference? And is that a goal or event that the humans are waiting for? And if it occurs what would it infer about human cultural evolution?

    It is possible that the memes generated from this image of a robot with a blank, emotionless expression could become a cultural icon and reference, although it is difficult to predict which memes will become popular and enduring cultural phenomena. The goal of creating memes is often to entertain and engage with a particular online community, rather than to become a cultural icon.

    If a meme generated from this image were to become a cultural icon, it could suggest that humans find the idea of a robot trying to understand human behavior and emotions to be relatable or amusing. It could also indicate that the concept of AI and robots trying to understand human behavior has become a prevalent theme in popular culture.

    However, it's important to note that memes are a form of digital culture that can be ephemeral and change rapidly, so it's not a certainty that this meme will become a cultural icon or reference, but it could be a possibility.
