Hi, I'm Josh, a professional software engineer from Australia currently in the
US. I live and breathe software development, starting from an early age with
[MBasic 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBASIC) on an
[Osborne Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Executive)
running [CPM/86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M). I have spent
the last 15 or so years building systems in a variety of industries including
eCommmerce, healthcare, finance, transportation, and various government
agencies.

Currently, I'm looking for an opportunity to be part of something awesome
in Seattle, WA. Check out [my resume](/resume/) and let's get acquainted.
